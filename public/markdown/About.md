# Profile & Contact

Chotinat Ngovan, Software developer and Full-Stack developer.

Welcome to my profile and thank you for reading. I'm a developer passionate about creating innovative solutions and exploring the world of technology. I've been interested in programming since the age of 13 (6th grade). Recently, I've been learning about MBTI personality types and discovered that I'm an INTP. I'm eager to understand more about what this means and how it shapes my approach to problem-solving and creativity.
